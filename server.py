Introduction:
    In this Project, I designed a Command and Control (C2) system to simulate malware on a Local Area Network (LAN) Virtual Machine (VM). 
    The system consists of two componentsâ€”a C2 server (server.py) deployed on a Wide Area Network (WAN) VM and a malware implant (client.py) 
    deployed on the LAN VM. The primary functionality of the C2 system involves listening for connections, implementing a port-knock 
    sequence, and executing predefined commands on the malware implant.
    

Summary:
    This is the C2 server code. 
    
    I kept some print statements to make reviewing and following the code easy.
    
    

Dependencies: 
    This code was written to be run on linux.
    
    If you try running it and get port in use errors (which are false positives), 
    type ctrl + O in terminal, and try again.
   
    If you lack any of the python packages (socket, threading, time),then install them with pip3 or pip.

Usage:

    Execute in Terminal:    python3 server.py
